#Project 1: Bank Analyzer

The idea is to Analyze Bank Statements. The user will feed a document to the
program and the document will return a custom description of important
statistics of the statements. 

The Document will need to return an HTML document that will summarize the
statements. 

Make an application that is capable of being scaled up.
